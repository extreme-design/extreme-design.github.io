This category of testing is comparable to software testing when a system is fed random or incorrect data, or data considered as \"boundary values\" of the input, e.g. the extremes of value ranges, in order to check robustness.</li><li><b>Inference Verification.</b>This testing procedure allows to verify that the inference mechanisms are in place, to ensure the correct fulfillment of the inference requirement.</li></ul>"
